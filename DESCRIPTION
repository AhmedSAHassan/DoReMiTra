Description: It is an R data package providing access to curated transcriptomic datasets
    related to blood radiation, with a focus on neutron, x-ray, and gamma ray studies.
    It is designed to facilitate radiation biology research and support data exploration
    and reproducibility in radiation transcriptomics. All datasets are provided as
    SummarizedExperiment objects, allowing seamless integration with the Bioconductor ecosystem.
