## ðŸ“¦ Installation

You can install the development version of `doremitra` from GitHub using:

```r
# Install devtools if not already installed
install.packages("devtools")

# Install doremitra from GitHub
devtools::install_github("AhmedSAHassan/doremitra")
```

ðŸ“˜ Overview
The package includes preprocessed and annotated datasets from public repositories (primarily GEO), with harmonized metadata and consistent formatting. Datasets can be filtered by:

âœ… Radiation type (neutron, x-ray, gamma ray)

âœ… Organism (e.g., human, mouse)

âœ… Disease status (healthy vs disease models)

âœ… Experimental setting (e.g., Vivo, Vitro)
